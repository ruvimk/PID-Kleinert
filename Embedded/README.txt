Project started by Ruvim Kondratyev, 
for Professor Michaela Kleinert's lab. 
November 2017 - February 2018 

Project purpose: 
PID controller for keeping a MOT happy for the Kleinert Lab. 

Current folder structure: 
- sketch_nov21a_data_stream_test 	-> A test: in the loop (), the code reads a voltage, and sends a time-voltage float pair (8 bytes) over Serial. 
- sketch_nov21a_pid_controller		-> The actual PID controller. See details in the README inside the sketch's folder.
